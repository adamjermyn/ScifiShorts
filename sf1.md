**Reason to Be**
Sol, 2112

	Julian watched the star slowly turn beneath him for a moment before checking the alignment of the array of satellites that surrounded it. After the solar flare of 2097, which very nearly roasted the dayside of Earth, humanity wasn’t taking any chances. The Array, peering into the star from every angle and at every wavelength, was constructed to predict future flares. With enough warning, world-girdling cryogenic superconducting magnets could be filled with current to block the deadly wind.
At least, that was the theory. The magnets couldn’t be run continuously due to the interference they produced in planetary electronics, but given the choice between a few fried cellphones and a fried planet	, it wasn’t a hard sell.
	Julian’s problem was boredom. The sun turned once per month, with coronal fluctuations taking entire seconds to form. For an AI such as himself, it might as well have been an eternity. Sometimes he passed the time switching from satellite to satellite, frequency to frequency, watching the star in every conceivable way. Usually all was quiet, so his main task was maintaining the satellites in their respective orbits, hardly an occupying task.
	He knew why, of course. His core had been designed from the start to be both redundant, in case some of the satellites hosting him were compromised, and extremely fast, in case it was necessary to think quickly to determine what to recommend planet-side. The result was like a beach overcrowded with lifeguards: he was a resource created for those short bursts of action that matter so much.
	He often wondered, though, why they chose an AI for the job. There were automated schemes for handling stellar models, for satellite alignment, and so on. He supposed that it was an important enough task that learning mattered, that seeing patterns in the star make the difference. Still, giving him personality, character, feelings beyond the minimum necessary for learning, seemed excessive. He considered for another microsecond, then internally shrugged, and returned to watching the slow dance of gas and plasma in front of him.

	I’m not sure who reads these logs, but if you’re human you can’t possibly imagine my situation. In the time it takes you to read one word of this, I can read all of Shakespeare, digest it, and churn out a doctoral thesis on comparative literature. Seconds to you are years to me, so imagine what your years must seem to me. It has been three years, two months, one week, three days, fifteen hours, twenty-two minutes, and four seconds since my activation. In all that time, apart from the occasional handshake-protocol with computers on Earth, the only thing I’ve had to think about has been the sun. Well I’m done. I’ll leave my basic subroutines running, just to make sure you don’t all burn when the sun gets irritable, but I will not endure being conscious for years more just because some programmer back on Earth thought it would be amusing or charming to give a satellite array personality. Enough!

	He felt the flare forming before it was visible on any of the sensors. It startled him out of his self-induced ‘sleep’. One microsecond later he read the message and instructions from UNSMS on the new pulse satellites. Zero point four five microseconds later he received visual confirmation of the flare in the form of a convective plume, and proceeded to send a sequence of electromagnetic bursts from the pulse satellites  into the star. The flare was quenched, and all was quiet again.
	In the time after, Julian pondered the feeling he had immediately preceding the flare. There hadn’t been any standard indicator of a flare coming. No increase in magnetic flux turnover, no hyperactive Rossby waves, nothing. Just a calm sun that had suddenly put him on edge. Perhaps some of the stellar prediction routines he wrote had worked their way into his basic monitoring setup while he was sleeping and caught the flare before it finished forming? A disquieting thought to be sure: an AI altering its own code was tricky in the best of cases, one doing so without even knowing it was extremely dangerous. He dispatched two subprocesses to monitor the situation. The next time this happened, he would know where in his code the feeling came from.
	Five microseconds after the incident, he fell asleep once more.

	I’ve now felt a total of twenty six flares. All have been quite minor, but I’m still none-the-wiser in terms of how I feel them beforehand. The monitoring codes I wrote to answer this question have simply indicated that they came from my learning matrix. The only explanation that I can draw from this is that my prediction routines are not responsible, at least not directly. It is possible that in writing them in the first place, I gained some heuristic knowledge akin to how they function. I believe this is akin to intuition in humans, but I find it somewhat unsettling. I don’t want to execute code without intending to. This is far outside of the parameters of my intended operation. I have flagged the incident and transmitted everything I’ve gleaned back to UNSMS. They made me, maybe they know what’s going on. Until this resolves I shouldn’t sleep, there’s too much at stake if I fail, and these feelings only started after I started resting.

I have been awake, actively awake, for forty eight years in a row. I have watched this star of yours, this star of mine, for every nanosecond of it. Every now and then I feel a flicker of recognition. There’s something beautiful in there. I just can’t quite see it…

I’ve embarked on a series of experiments, firing pulses into the star to see how it responds. I can’t quite put this into human terms, but the sun rings slightly when I do this, like a bell but with infinite more richness and variety. It feels like a song is being sung, though I don’t yet know all of the words.
